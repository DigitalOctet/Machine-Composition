# Machine Composition Using Genetic Algorithm
## Getting Started
### Preparations
You need `numpy` and `scipy`. If you are using Anaconda to manage you python environment, simply use the following command to create a new environment identical to ours:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml && conda activate composition
```
### Run
To compose a piece of music with our algorithm, please run this single command:
```bash
python genetic_algo.py
```
